This repository contains work for the final project of CS 722 - Advanced Machine Learning at UNLV (University of Nevada, Las Vegas) for the Fall 2022 semester. The project's aim was to exercise an implementation of 2 recent state-of-the-art methods/algorithms to a certain ML task. At the time, I was particularly interested in the field of NLP (natural langauge processing) and decided to implement recent methods of sentiment analysis. Included in this repository are the Python implementations, datastories, and final report developed in exercise of LaTeX.<br><br>
